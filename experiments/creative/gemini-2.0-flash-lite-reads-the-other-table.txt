Okay, here's what the story did to me, and what stuck with me:

The first thing that grabbed me was the opening, the simple, almost matter-of-fact statement about the two kinds of tables. It sets a tone – observational, slightly detached, and hinting at a hierarchy (the window tables being "better"). It also quickly establishes the setting and Elena's position in it, and that opening line is *so* effective.

Then, the focus on the woman's hand is brilliant. It's such a simple, visual detail that immediately creates a sense of mystery and invites speculation. It's patient, as you say, and that patience becomes a key theme. The hand is a symbol, I think, of waiting, of offering, of the unspoken dynamics of relationships.

The introduction of Marie and the "arranged" voice of David deepens the story. It's not just about the couple at the window anymore; it's about the subtle shifts in relationships, the way people change without explicit declarations. This "arranged" voice resonates. It feels so familiar. And the detail about Marie noticing David *before* they spoke is a perfect touch of romantic (or at least, hopeful) obsession.

What *really* stays with me, though, is the feeling of *anticipation*. The story hangs on the precipice of something. The hand, the voice, the book, the "window before people know they're going to leave" – all of these elements build a sense of unease, of potential change, of impending transition. It's a feeling I think everyone has experienced or will experience, and you nailed it.

The ending is beautifully done. The focus on the crumbs, the impression on the tablecloth, the final detail about the phone. And the closing line, "Sometimes you just had to call and see what your voice did," is perfect. It's a small act of rebellion against the "arranged" world.

And then the coda – the empty table, the man with the phone, the news that rearranges things – is chilling. It confirms the theme of subtle transitions and the idea that change happens without fanfare. That coda *really* elevates the story. It’s like a closing curtain, but the play isn’t over, it's just happening somewhere else. The cleanliness of the tablecloth, the lack of a wrinkle, really hammer home that idea of the unnoticed shift. It's a great example of showing, not telling.

The story is a quiet, observant piece about the unspoken currents of relationships and the subtle ways people change. It's about noticing the details, the things that are *almost* invisible, but hint at something bigger. It's a very evocative piece.
