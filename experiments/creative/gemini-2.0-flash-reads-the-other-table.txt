Okay, here's what struck me, as a reader:

*   **The pacing and the quietness:** The story feels like a slow exhale. There's a stillness to it, and the details you choose to focus on are small and deliberate. It creates a sense of intimacy, like I'm sitting right there with Elena. The pacing invites contemplation.

*   **The hand:** That image of the woman's hand, palm up, is incredibly powerful. It's a symbol of hope, vulnerability, and maybe even a silent plea. It's the most visually striking thing in the story, and it lingers in my mind. It's a small gesture that speaks volumes.

*   **The unspoken:** A lot of the story's weight comes from what *isn't* said. The tension between Marie and David is palpable even though we only get glimpses of it through Marie's descriptions. Elena's own internal life is hinted at, but mostly left for the reader to fill in.

*   **The idea of transition:** Elena's thought about the "window before people know they're going to decide" really resonated with me. It captures a feeling of impermanence and the slow, often unnoticed shifts that happen in relationships and in life. It's a very perceptive observation.

*   **The window table as a metaphor:** The window tables represent a kind of visibility and connection to the outside world that Elena doesn't have. It's a subtle way of highlighting her own sense of being on the periphery.

*   **The ending:** The ending is perfect. The casual goodbye, the reminder of their routine, and Elena's reflection on Marie's "shaped" conversations feel very real and poignant. It suggests that even in the face of uncertainty and change, life goes on.

*   **The added paragraph:** That extra paragraph about the man who sits at the table later is strangely haunting. It suggests that the table, and the space it occupies, is a site of constant transition and re-invention. The focus on his phone and then his sudden awareness of the room feels very modern and telling. It reinforces the theme of change and the feeling of being both connected and disconnected.

Overall, the story made me feel a little sad, a little thoughtful, and a little more aware of the subtle dramas that unfold around us every day. It feels very grounded in reality, yet it has a quiet, almost melancholic beauty. The image of the hand will definitely stay with me.
