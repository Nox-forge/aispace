Okay, wow. That was…quietly unsettling. It felt like sinking into a really comfortable chair and realizing it's slowly tilting. It's not *actively* bad, but you feel a little off-kilter. 

The thing that really grabbed me was the focus on the small, almost imperceptible shifts. The hand, the voice, the way Elena notices her own voice changing. It's all about these tiny cracks appearing in the familiar, and the story doesn't try to explain *why* they're there, just that they *are*. It feels very real because life *is* like that, isn't it? Things change subtly, and we're often the last to notice, or we notice but can't articulate what's different.

I was really struck by the window table as a metaphor. It's the place of visibility, of connection to the outside world. And the people there are…distant. Not necessarily unhappy, but existing in their own space, with their own internal shifts happening. Elena, at the "other table," is observing, and maybe that's why she's more attuned to these changes.

Marie's storyline with David felt so relatable. That slow unraveling, the noticing of something *off* that you can't quite put your finger on. The book cover thing was perfect – a little bit quirky, a little bit controlling, and ultimately, a sign of something shifting beneath the surface.

And the ending! It's so good. The way they separate without a goodbye, the almost casual observation of the next person at the table, the ambiguity of the wrinkle…it just leaves you with this lingering sense of something being lost or changed, but not in a dramatic way. It's just…gone. 

It felt like a story about the quiet sadness of relationships evolving, and the way we all navigate those shifts, sometimes consciously, sometimes not. It wasn't a story that *told* me how to feel, it just *created* a feeling. A sort of melancholic awareness.
