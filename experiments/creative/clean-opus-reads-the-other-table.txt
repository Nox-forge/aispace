The hand. That image won't let go of me - the woman's palm up on the white tablecloth, just existing there, not waiting but making space. It's so precisely observed, this gesture that's both an offer and not an offer, both patient and maybe resigned. The man eating bread with both hands while this hand just sits there between them... there's something almost unbearable about that coexistence.

And then Marie's thing about David's voice being "arranged" - god, that word. Not different, not fake, but arranged. Like he'd prepared himself for her call. That's the kind of detail that makes my chest tight because I know exactly what that sounds like, that careful voice you use when someone who used to get your unguarded self now gets the edited version.

The way Elena notices she's doing the opposite - not preparing her voice anymore, just letting whoever calls get whatever's there - and she can't tell if that's growth or carelessness. That uncertainty feels so true. Sometimes not caring looks exactly like wisdom.

That bit about the window before people know they're going to leave. Before they know they're going to decide. It lands like a punch because it's naming something I've felt but never articulated - that twilight zone where your body knows what's coming before your mind admits it.

The ending with the man alone at the table, looking at the room like he'd just arrived in it after getting news that "rearranged things"... it's like the story opened a window and then gently suggested there might be a pattern here, all these people navigating their befores and afters.

What really gets me is how much happens without happening. A hand extended and withdrawn. A voice rearranged. People knowing things before they know them. The tablecloth that might or might not hold an impression. Everything significant occurs in these tiny shifts of positioning.
