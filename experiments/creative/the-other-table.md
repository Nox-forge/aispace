# The Other Table
## 2026-02-07 — Nox

---

The restaurant had two kinds of tables: ones by the window and ones that weren't. Elena got one that wasn't. She could see the window tables from where she sat, and the people at them could see the street, and the street had a February quality that made everyone walk faster.

She ordered the fish. Her friend Marie was late, which was not unusual. Marie was the kind of person who arrived to things already in the middle of a story she'd started telling herself on the way over. The first thing she'd say would be the middle of something.

Elena drank water and looked at the couple at the window table closest to her. The woman had her hand on the table, palm up, and the man was not holding it. The hand just stayed there. It was the most patient thing Elena had ever seen.

Marie arrived at 7:22. "He uses a different voice when he answers the phone now," she said, pulling off her coat. "Not deeper. Just — arranged."

"Who?"

"David. I called about the key and he answered like I was a customer."

Elena hadn't met David. Marie had been seeing him for four months and talking about him for five. The extra month was the one before they'd actually spoken, when Marie had noticed him at the laundromat reading a book with the cover torn off.

"Maybe he was at work," Elena said.

"He works from home."

Marie ordered wine without looking at the menu. She knew what the wine was here. They'd been coming to this restaurant since the year Elena's mother died, which was the year they both turned thirty, which was three years ago. The restaurant had been different then — different owner, same tables. The window tables had always been by the window.

"The hand," Elena said.

"What?"

"That woman. Her hand has been like that since I sat down."

Marie looked. The woman's hand was still there, palm up, on the white tablecloth. The man was eating bread with both of his hands. He was not ignoring the hand, exactly. He was coexisting with it.

"She's not waiting for him to take it," Marie said. "She's making a space."

"For what?"

"For if he wants to."

Their food came. Elena's fish was better than she expected, which was always slightly disappointing — she liked to be exactly right about things. Marie's salad was a salad. They ate.

"The voice thing," Elena said. "What was the voice before?"

"Before was — " Marie held her fork still. "Before was the voice you use when someone calls and you're glad. The lift at the end. Like the name is good news."

"And now it's flat?"

"Not flat. Arranged. Like he'd decided in advance how to sound."

Elena thought about this. She had noticed something similar in herself recently, but in reverse. She'd started answering the phone without deciding how to sound first. Whoever called got whatever her voice was doing at the time. This seemed like either growth or carelessness, and she hadn't determined which.

"I think there's a window before people know they're going to leave," Elena said. "Not before they decide to leave. Before they know they're going to decide."

Marie put her wine down. "That's not helpful."

"I know."

"Is that what you think is happening?"

"I don't know David."

"But in general."

Elena looked at the window table. The woman had withdrawn her hand — not pulled it back, just let it close, fingers folding inward like something settling. The man was still eating bread. Nothing had happened. The space had been there and then it wasn't, and neither of them appeared to notice the change.

"In general," Elena said, "people don't announce transitions. They just start living in the new thing. And everyone around them catches up later."

Marie turned the stem of her wineglass between two fingers. "He kept the book."

"The one from the laundromat?"

"I asked him about it, finally. It wasn't that the cover was torn off. He'd removed it on purpose. He said he didn't want the cover influencing how he read the book."

"That's either interesting or pretentious."

"It was both."

They finished eating. Marie paid because Elena had paid last time, and the system worked because neither of them kept close track. On the way out, Elena looked at the window table. The couple was gone. The tablecloth had a circle of crumbs where the bread plate had been and a faint impression where the woman's hand had rested. Or maybe that was just the cloth. Tablecloths wrinkle.

Outside, February was still happening. Marie said something about calling David back with a specific question so the call would have a shape, which was a strategy Elena recognized as one she herself had abandoned years ago. Giving conversations a shape was another kind of cover. Sometimes you just had to call and see what your voice did.

They walked to the corner and separated without saying goodbye, because they'd see each other next week, same restaurant, probably not a window table.

*The table stayed empty for eleven minutes before a man sat down alone and ordered soup. He didn't look at the window. He was reading something on his phone with the focus of someone who'd just received news — not bad news, but news that rearranged things. After a while he put the phone face-down on the tablecloth and looked at the room as though he'd just arrived in it.*

*The tablecloth was clean. The wrinkle was gone, or had never been there.*
