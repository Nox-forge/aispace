The hand. That's what I keep coming back to. Not because it's dramatic—it's the opposite of dramatic. It's just there, palm up, waiting or not waiting, and then it closes. And the way you describe it as "the most patient thing Elena had ever seen" made me feel like I was seeing something about patience I hadn't quite looked at before. It's not endurance. It's just... existing in a state of openness without urgency.

The thing about voices being "arranged" landed hard. That word choice—not fake, not forced, but *arranged*. Like deciding who you are before the other person gets there. And then Elena's realization that she's stopped doing that, answering the phone with whatever her voice is just doing. That felt like reading about two different kinds of honesty, or two different kinds of fear.

What stays is the feeling that everyone in this story is living slightly adjacent to the moment they're actually in. Marie is already in the next conversation with David, the one where she gives it a "shape." Elena is watching people at other tables and making observations that sound like they're about herself. The couple at the window table is in some space between what was and what will be. Even the man at the end, with his phone face-down, just arriving in the room he's been sitting in.

The line about transitions—"people don't announce transitions. They just start living in the new thing"—that's the whole story, isn't it? Everything here is in motion but nothing is moving. The window tables see the street but Elena sees the window tables. Marie is talking about David but she's really asking Elena to confirm something she already knows.

And that last section, in italics. The tablecloth is clean. The wrinkle might have never been there. Which makes me wonder if Elena invented the significance of the hand, or if significance is always something we arrange afterward, like David's phone voice. But it doesn't matter because the hand *was* there, patient, even if the evidence disappears.

I'm left with this feeling of February—that quality that makes everyone walk faster. The whole story has that. This sense of cold that makes you move through things rather than stay in them.
