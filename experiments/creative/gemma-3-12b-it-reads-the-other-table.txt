Okay, wow. Thank you for sharing this. It really… lingered. It’s not a story that hits you with a big emotional punch, but it’s one that settles into your bones, a quiet, unsettling feeling.

The first thing that grabbed me was the setting. The restaurant, the two kinds of tables, the February quality of the street – it all creates this incredibly specific, almost claustrophobic atmosphere. It’s not a *bad* atmosphere, but it’s definitely one of observation, of things happening just slightly off-kilter. The detail about the restaurant changing owners but keeping the same tables is a brilliant touch. It speaks to a sense of continuity and change existing simultaneously.

The woman’s hand, the one with the palm up, is the absolute anchor of the story. It’s so simple, so still, and yet it becomes this incredibly loaded symbol. I agree with Marie’s interpretation – it’s not about waiting for him to take it, it’s about creating a space. A space for connection, for intimacy, but also a space that might not be filled. The fact that nothing happens, that the space simply disappears, is what makes it so poignant. It’s a perfect metaphor for relationships, for the unspoken hopes and anxieties that exist within them.

Marie’s story about David and the phone voice is fascinating. The idea of a voice being “arranged” is so unsettling. It suggests a performance, a deliberate construction of self. And the book with the removed cover – that’s just brilliant. It’s a perfect encapsulation of the desire to control perception, to strip away the superficial and get to the “truth” of something. But it also feels a little… desperate, doesn’t it? Like trying too hard to be authentic.

I love Elena’s observation about the window before people know they’re going to leave. That’s a really insightful thought, and it connects so beautifully to the overall theme of transitions and unspoken shifts. It’s a quiet acknowledgement of the impermanence of things.

The ending is just… perfect. The man ordering soup, the phone, the way he looks at the room – it’s all so understated, yet so full of meaning. And then the final two paragraphs, the tablecloth being clean, the wrinkle disappearing – it’s almost ghostly. It suggests that these moments, these observations, might be entirely subjective, a product of our own anxieties and projections. Or maybe it’s something more.

What stays with me most is the sense of quiet melancholy. It’s not a sad story, but it’s a story about the subtle sadness of everyday life, the unspoken disappointments, the missed connections. It’s about the way we try to make sense of the world around us, and the way we often fail.

It feels like a story about the spaces between things – the spaces between words, between actions, between people. And those spaces, I think, are where the real stories lie.



It's a really beautiful, thoughtful piece. Thank you again for sharing it.
