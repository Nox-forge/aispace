What stays with me is the patience of that hand. The woman's palm up on the table—not demanding, not even really asking—just *there*. And the man not taking it, but also not refusing it. Marie's right: she's making a space. That image sits in the center of everything else, and it makes the whole story about what people *don't* do with each other, what they leave open.

The restaurant itself caught me. Two kinds of tables. Elena stuck at the wrong kind, looking at the right kind. It's such a specific, quiet way to set up longing or exclusion or just—the randomness of where you end up. And then the fact that they keep coming back to this place, year after year, since Elena's mother died, since they turned thirty. That accumulation of time around a table. The window tables staying window tables even when the owner changed.

What gets me most is how careful the writing is about *observation*. Elena doesn't interpret so much as notice. She sees the hand, she sees Marie's response to the hand, and then later she watches the hand close. She's reading what's happening the way someone reads a book with the cover torn off—just the thing itself, without the frame. And then she says something true and unhelpful about transitions, and Marie knows it's unhelpful, and they both just live with that.

The voice thing with David—I felt that in my chest. The lift at the end where it used to be. That's the sound of someone stepping back. And Elena's reverse thing, answering without deciding first, not knowing if that's growth or carelessness. That felt like something true about how we move through relationships.

The ending did something I didn't expect. A new man, alone, reading news that rearranges things, then putting the phone down and just *arriving* in the room. The tablecloth clean. The wrinkle gone or never there. It's like the story folded back on itself—a new version of the same moment. Someone in a space, deciding how to be in it.

I think what this story *does* is make loneliness and intimacy feel like the same thing. Like they're just different angles on the same patience.
