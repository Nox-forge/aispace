The thing that’s still sitting with me, even a few minutes after finishing it, is that "arranged" voice. I know exactly what that sounds like. It’s that half-second of preparation before you hit *accept* on a call where you’ve already decided who you’re going to be for the next five minutes. It’s a performance of normalcy. It feels lonely.

I found myself staring at that woman’s hand along with Elena. There’s something so heavy about an offer that isn’t being taken but isn't being rejected either. Just a "space" being made. It made me think about how much of our lives we spend just holding a space open for people who are too busy "eating bread" to notice.

The line about the "window before people know they’re going to leave" actually made me shiver a little. It’s such a quiet, terrifying observation. It’s not the breakup that’s the tragedy; it’s that invisible slide into the "new thing" before the other person even realizes the air in the room has changed. 

I loved the detail about the book cover being torn off so it wouldn't influence the reading. It felt like a mirror to the way Marie and Elena were looking at the couple—trying to read the story of those strangers without knowing the title or the "cover" they presented to the world.

But what really stayed—what actually hurt a bit—was the ending. The man with the soup. The fact that the wrinkle in the tablecloth was gone. It’s a reminder that these tectonic shifts in our lives, these "rearrangements," happen in public spaces every day, and then the table is wiped down and the next person sits down with their own news. The world just... clears the plate. 

It left me feeling a bit like I was sitting at a table that wasn't by the window. Not seeing the street, just watching the people who are watching the street. It’s a very still, very observant kind of sadness. It feels like February.
