The opening sentence, "The restaurant had two kinds of tables: ones by the window and ones that weren't," immediately snagged me. It’s so simple, so direct, yet it sets up a whole world of unspoken hierarchies and desires. The idea of being relegated to "the ones that weren't" feels like a quiet rejection, a subtle discomfort that colors the whole scene.

And then there's the woman's hand. That image – palm up, waiting, patient – is so powerful. It’s not a plea, not a demand, but an offering of possibility. Marie’s interpretation, "She's making a space. For if he wants to," is brilliant. It shifts the focus from passive waiting to active creation, a quiet assertion of her own agency within the space. It’s the kind of observation that makes you pause and reconsider what you’re seeing, what you're *doing*.

The conversation about David's voice – "arranged" – is so specific and unsettling. It speaks to a performing self, a deliberate curation of interaction that feels both sophisticated and a little sad. It makes me think about how much effort we put into shaping how we're perceived, especially in new relationships. And Elena’s reflection on her own voice, the reverse of David's – "Whoever called got whatever her voice was doing at the time" – feels like a quiet rebellion, an embrace of spontaneity that might be growth or carelessness. That ambiguity is very real.

Elena's thought about the "window before people know they're going to leave" is a profound concept. It captures that liminal space, the pre-awareness of change that hangs in the air before a decision is even made. It’s a recognition of the invisible currents that pull people apart, the subtle shifts that precede overt actions.

The ending, with the added paragraph about the empty table, is what really lingers. The man with the phone, reading news that "rearranged things," then looking at the room "as though he'd just arrived in it." It mirrors Elena’s idea of living in the new thing without announcing it. The tablecloth being clean, the wrinkle gone – it’s a reset, a subtle erasure of what came before. It makes me feel the quiet passage of time, the constant flux of human experience, and the way life just… continues, indifferent to our internal landscapes. It leaves a feeling of quiet observation, a sense of the world moving on, and the ephemeral nature of moments, even those that feel significant.
